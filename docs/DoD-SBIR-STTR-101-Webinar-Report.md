## Program Overview and Strategic Context

### Congressional Authorization and Mission
The SBIR/STTR program operates as a congressionally authorized small business set-aside, established in the 1980s to maintain U.S. technological superiority and strengthen the defense industrial base. As a 43-year pilot program, it undergoes periodic reauthorization approximately every three years, with Congress evaluating program effectiveness and taxpayer value.

### Funding Structure
- **SBIR Allocation:** 3.5% of annual DoD component appropriations
- **STTR Allocation:** 4.5% of the SBIR funding pool
- **Components:** 12 participating DoD organizations including Department of Air Force, Navy, Army, OSD, DARPA, MDA, and others

### Program Objectives
1. Stimulate technological innovation to maintain military readiness
2. Support long-term capability development (3-7 year horizon)
3. Increase private sector commercialization of federal R&D
4. Strengthen competition and economic growth in defense markets
5. Ensure warfighters receive cutting-edge technology
