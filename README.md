# IPN Startup Resources

This repo is for anyone in the IPN network — or beyond — trying to build something real.

Whether you’re just getting started or already deep in the game, my goal with this is simple: give you working, remixable tools you can deploy today. *Automations. Prompts. Agents. Frameworks. Systems.* Things I wish I had when I started my journey.

I’m sharing what I use, what works, and how it all connects.

## 🧰 What You’ll Find Here

This repo is a growing collection of:
- Ready-to-run automations (like n8n workflows)
- Agent prompt templates and decision frameworks
- Lightweight stack ideas for bootstrapping
- Curated open-source tools to help you move fast without burning capital

Start with what clicks for you. No need to understand it all at once.

## ⚡ Featured Workflow: Telegram AI Agent (Built in n8n + LangChain)

A fully operational Telegram bot that connects to an AI agent using LangChain. It routes tool calls (Gmail, Bitly, Weather, etc), enriches prompts, and logs chat memory to Postgres.

Great for:
- Personal productivity bots
- Client service assistants
- Lightweight co-founders

Setup instructions are in [`n8n-telegram-ai-agent-readme.md`](./n8n-telegram-ai-agent-readme.md)  
Workflow JSON is here: [`n8n-telegram-ai-agent-example.json`](./n8n-telegram-ai-agent-example.json)

## 🚀 Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aporb/ipn-startup-resources.git
cd ipn-startup-resources
````

Then open the README for whichever workflow you want to test. Most are self-contained and portable.

## 🧠 How to Use This

* Don’t copy everything — study how it solves a problem, then tailor it.
* Store your credentials securely using n8n’s built-in tools.
* Run locally first, then move to Docker or the cloud when you’re ready.
* Want a demo? DM me in the IPN group or drop a question.

## 🤝 Want to Contribute?

If you’ve built something cool or have a tool you think others can benefit from:

* Fork this repo and submit a pull request
* Or just DM me and I’ll help you add it in
