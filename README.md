This repo is for anyone in the IPN network ‚Äî or beyond ‚Äî trying to build something real.

Whether you're just getting started or already deep in the game, my goal with this is simple: give you working, remixable tools you can deploy today. *Automations. Prompts. Agents. Frameworks. Systems.* Things I wish I had when I started my journey.

I'm sharing what I use, what works, and how it all connects.

## üåç Bigger Picture

I built this for the people I wish I had on the journey.

### The Mission
Too many great ideas die not from lack of vision, but from lack of practical, working tools. This repository bridges that gap by providing real, deployable solutions you can adapt and scale.

### The Community
Whether you're part of the Ismaili Professional Network or any community looking to build meaningful solutions, this is for builders who believe that smart automation and AI can level the playing field.

### The Impact
Every workflow, prompt, and framework here has been battle-tested in real businesses. Take what works, adapt it to your context, and build something that matters.
